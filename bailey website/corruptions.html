            <h2>Corrupting Video Games</h2>
            
            <p>When you talk about corrupting a game, most people are quick to ask why, why would you go of your way to break video games?</p>
            
            <p>The answer: It's hilarious.</p>
            
            <p>By utilizing a program called Real-Time Corruptor, anyone can corrupt data into virtual memory chips of emulated video game consoles. In addition to a user friendly interface, its highly customizable, and comes with one of the best "hobbies" any computer software has ever offered.</p>
            
            <h2>Glitch Harvesting</h2>
            
            <p>The Corruption Savestate Manager, or Glitch Harvester, is an awesome combination of being both fun and productive. First, it starts with the random blasts of corruptions, trying to find a change. Once a blast has a desirable change, you can save the randomness to the stash. That means you can make those exact changes to the memory!</p>
            
            <p>Once saved, we can sanatize the blast, and find out exactly what values in memory we are editting to create a different effect. We can mix and match these edits to create custom, specific corruptions that change the game in drastic ways, such as inverting color schemes or loading levels incorrectly. Finally, we can save our glitch into a stockpile, can be shared to others that want to replicate your homemade corruptions.</p>
