        <p>Originally, this commercial was going to be for a time machine that can let you relive your past. This combined with philosophy homework turned a huge u-turn during it's development, and I opted for a PSA on kindness. The stock piano music turned a little electrofunky captures that sense of redemption, and I do personally like the version without subtitles more. All in all, I'm very proud of what I've made and I hope you enjoy it as well!</p>
        
        <p>The critique process really didn't change much, the biggest change people wanted was better audio balancing and subtitles, so I added the subtitles. I personally do not like them, but this does make my commercial more accessable.</p>
        
        Group Member Critiques:
        <ul>
            <li>Lex: I really liked this piece, and it's use of music and narration is great. I think this also would benefit from better audio balancing and subtitles.</li>
            <li>Chris: I liked how clean the beginning of the video was, but the narration quality (of the microphone) was very bad. It also loops, and needs more stock footage to make it longer.</li>
            <li>Warren: The video's were fun to watch, but I didn't pick up on any custom sounds he created for the lava PSA. The text at the end could definately use some contrasting background.</li>
